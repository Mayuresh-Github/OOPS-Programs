All modern operating systems have their roots in 1969 when Dennis Ritchie and Ken
Thompson developed the C language and the Unix operating system at AT&T Bell Labs.
They shared their source code (yes, there was open source back in the Seventies) with the rest of the world, including the hippies in Berkeley California. By 1975, when AT&T started
selling Unix commercially, about half of the source code was written by others. 
The hippies were not happy that a commercial company sold software that they had written; the resulting (legal) battle ended in there being two versions of Unix: the official AT&T Unix, and the free BSD Unix.
A Linux distribution is a collection of (usually open source) software on top of a Linux kernel. 
A distribution (or short, distro) can bundle server software, system management tools, documentation and many desktop applications in a central secure software repository. 
A distro aims to provide a common look and feel, secure and easy software management and often a specific operational purpose.
